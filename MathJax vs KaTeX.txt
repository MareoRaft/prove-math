MathJax server-side
========================
https://github.com/mathjax/MathJax-node

this project renders the mathjax on the server's side and sends over the HTML.  This is the same thing that KaTeX does to gain speed.




MathJax
===========
supports everything.  not as pretty as KaTeX.  May have SLOW side-effect.




KaTeX
========
Pros: KA actually runs KaTeX first and then for anything that can't be rendered, MathJax!  This is actually very nice.  Benefits without the bad stuff! The following link shows how you use a plain old try and catch to do it:
https://github.com/Khan/KaTeX/issues/186
go direct to the source!  THIS is how you do it:
https://github.com/Khan/KaTeX#usage

all the files are missing the define(function(require, exports, module){ ... }) wrapper!  I will make a perl file to add them on.
now the require("./") sugar is interpreting paths from the baseUrl, instead of the relative location of the file!


What's missing from KaTeX?

\mapsto
\longrightarrow
\longmapsto

matrices

piecewise function definitions

n \choose k

nth root

\sim  (supposedly) arrays and eq alignments not supported






Conclusion (thus far)
========================
Since we plan to support all sorts of math, we really need MathJax's wide support.  We should start w/ MathJax and then look into performance improvements through server-side rendering or KaTeX add-on in the future.
