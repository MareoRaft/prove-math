Definition
===========

definition: "bla" # the definition
note: "bla" (optional) # pointing out any important technicalities about the definition.  also, mention common synonyms if they are important enough to be mentioned
intuition: "bla" (optional but almost always present) # an intuitive explanation of what the definition means
example: "bla" (one example always present) # an example. typically there should be 3 examples.
counterexample: "bla" # counterexamples in the case of a definition will be something that one may naively believe to fit the definition, but it actually does not fit the definition.  these examples of what does NOT fit the definition will help the learner to understand.



Theorem
========

theorem: "bla" # statement of theorem
# intuition?
# examples?
proof: "bla" # a proof of the theorem. in the future, proofs can be tagged as "geometric" proofs or "algebraic" proof or "inductive" proof, etc.  the best proof of each tag should be on top.
