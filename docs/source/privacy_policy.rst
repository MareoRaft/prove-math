Privacy Policy
================

Document effective 3 June, 2016

We may change this Privacy Policy from time to time. If we make changes, we will notify you by revising the date at the top of this policy.

ProveMath does not share personal information with third parties nor do we store any information about your visit to ProveMath other than what is detailed below.


Collection of Outside Information
--------------------------------------


When you grant permission for ProveMath to access your oauth provider (facebook, github, linkedin, or google+), we gain access to your basic information.  Which information this includes is determined by your oauth provider (and you can look it up there).

This is the information we actually use:
  1. Your oauth ID (to link your account to your oauth provider, so that you can login again).
  2. That's it!!  In the future, we may include your oauth username, so that our website can say "Hello, Bill!" for example, or so you can interact with other users under your username.



Automatically Collected Information
------------------------------------------
When you log in, we save your progress so that we can restore it on your next visit.

Whenever our server must update the website (for example: you learn a node and the server sends over some new nodes), information about the speed of the server's response is recorded.  This is so that we can identify any slowness in our server and improve it when necessary.

When an error/glitch occurs in our code, a trace of what caused the error is logged on our server.  This is so that we can identify the problem and fix it.



Cookies
----------

If you log into ProveMath, ProveMath attempts to store a cookie in your browser containing you oauth ID.  This information is not enough to access your oauth account without your password.  However, if other people have access to your computer/browser, they can potentially read your oauth ID.  You can turn off the use of cookies at anytime by changing your specific browser settings.
