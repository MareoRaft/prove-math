These two files are things that MathJax depends on.  With the presence of these, we can load mathjax locally, yay!

They are version 2.6.1.

There is actually a version 2.6.1-rc1 also, which is something to keep in mind, in case something doesn't work ever. (see https://github.com/mathjax/MathJax and look under "tags" in the branches dropdown)
