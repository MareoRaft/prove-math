MathZoom.js and MathMenu.js are two files that MathJax depends on.  With the presence of these, we can load mathjax locally, yay!

The two files being used should NOT be suffixed with a version number.  Any files NOT being used SHOULD be suffixed with a version number.



There is actually a version 2.6.1-rc1 also, which is something to keep in mind, in case something doesn't work ever. (see https://github.com/mathjax/MathJax and look under "tags" in the branches dropdown)
