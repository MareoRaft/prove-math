Ali
-----
  1. Abstr. Algebra (intro)


Matt
------
  * Abstract Algebra (intro, abstr alg i, abstr alg ii)

Tom
-----
  1. Analysis (in the future we will "project" this to make RU advanced calculus by applying restrictions, then adding the extra theorems that come out of these restrictions.)
  * Logic (matt will get some notes)
  * Set Theory (ZFC)


Think about later
------------------
  * complex analysis
  * Topology


Done
-----------------
  * Combinatorics! (summer course finished)
  * Graph Theory (already done up to intro level) NEEDS SOME CLEANING UP:
>  * separate compound node
>  * are all Gallai thms there?  alpha + beta = |V| and alpha' + beta' = |V|
>  * make sure all thms in graph theory.txt in math folder are on there
>  * see if tom has notes from first half of course
