If you are not Ali and are reading these notes, be sure to tell him if there are mathematical or
typographical errors in this document. Talk to him in class or email him at
\href{mailto:ali.haider.ismail@rutgers.edu}{ali.haider.ismail@rutgers.edu}. If you see three
large stars (like \attention{}) it is because the concept in question confuses me. If you can
explain these be sure to let me know.
