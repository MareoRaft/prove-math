	Let p1,,,pk be the unique prime divisors of n.
	To count the # of numbers relatively prime to n, start with n and subtract off # multiples of p1, and # multiples of p2, etc.  But then you overcounted, so add on # multiples of p1p2, and all other pairs.  But then you overcounted, so subtract off triples, etc.  Factor out n.  Factor the result, and you obtain the formula.

	Here is my guess at why this is called the lower "central" series:  Look at the series backwards, where G[i] is the identity.  G[i-1] is central in G.  G[i-1] mod G[i] is central in G mod G[i].  G[i-k] mod G[i-l+1] is central in G mod G[i-k+1].  This should be verified!

Group Actions
----------------

def
X is a set.  G __acts__ on X from the left if there is a map
G x X \to X
(g,x) to g.x

1.5.3
def
To generalize "action" above further, if X has an additional structure (group, ring, field, etc), then we require that each g(X) preserves the structure in order for it to be called an action.
Otherwise stated, we require that pi_g in Aut(X).

In particular, note that if X is a V.S., then pi_g in Aut(X) = GL(X) is called a __linear representation__.
(because each element of Aut(X) is *represented* by a *linear* function (each invertible matrix is linear))

1.5.5
def
G acts on X.  The __stabilizer__ of x in X is the set of all elements in g that fix x.
denotation: Stab_G(x), Stab(x), G_x,
note: Stab(x) is a subgroup of G.
We also define the Stab(Y) for any subset Y of X.  (g.Y = Y)
We also define the __fixer__ of Y, Fix_G(Y), Fix(Y) so that every element of Y is fixed.

1.5.6
A __free__ action is an action where for all x in X, Stab(X) = {e}.

examples
	e. If X is G/H (The set of cosets), then the Stab(gH) is gHg^{-1}.
	f. G acts on itself by conjugation.  Then for any H <= G, the Stab(H) is the N_G(H).
	   And the Fix(H) is the C_G(H) (centralizer of H)

Stab(g.x) = g Stab(x) g^{-1}

phi : G \to S(X) by
phi(g) = pi_g is called the "associated group hom"

G.x is the orbit of x.

X is partitioned into its orbits.

Let's consider

|G| = sum | G.x |

If G acts on X by conjugation then G.x is the conjugacy class of x, and G_x is all elements that commute with x, a.k.a. C(x).

So

|G| = |Z(G)| + sum |G.x|

for the x's on the right *not* in Z(G), and therefore these G.x's have size greater than 1.

|G| = |Z(G)| + sum [G : C(x)]

		G is nilpotent, so H is nilpotent, and if U exists, U is nilpotent.
		Look at G/H.  Find a subgrp of order p.  Go back to G.  It's U!
		But how to find that subgrp?
		Remember that in the lower central series, [G,G] is the commutator sbgrp.
		So G/[G,G] is the abelianizer of G, so G/[G,G] is abelian.
		Also, p | |G/[G,G]|, so there exists a subgrp of G/[G,G] of order p. (previous theorem (there exists el of order p))
		If H contains [G,G], just use the above trick with H instead of [G,G].

pf

	(b) and (c)
	Cool proof that n_p divides m.  Let P = Pp.
	By induction on |P|:
	Base case:
	|P| = 1.  By (a), every Sylow p-subgroup is trivial.  Then n_p = 1, which divides m, and equiv 1 mod p.
	Ind step:
	|P| > 1.  A nontrivial p-group has a nontrivial center.  The other p-groups are of the form gPg^{-1}, so they have the SAME center Z(P) as each other.  Z(P) is contained and normal in each Sylow p-subgroup, and in G.  Now mod all of those things out by Z(P).  The P' are the Sylow p-subgroups of G', and since z = |Z(P)| > 1, their orders are LESS.  By the inductive hypothesis, n_p' divides (|G|/p^e)/z and n_p' equiv 1 mod p.  But n_p' = n_p, so n_p divides |G|/p^e and n_p equiv 1 mod p.

Free groups and presentations
--------------------------------

1.8.1
Construction of free groups

Let X be the set of possible elements.
Let Y = X union X', where ' means inverse
Let W(X) be the set of "words" on Y (yes, Y)
def
w,v are __elementary equivalent__ if
	i) w = w1w2 and v = w1yy'w2 for some y in Y, or vice-versa (switching w and v)
def
w,v are __equivalent__ if w=v or there exists a finite sequence of elementary equivalences that convert w to v.

def
F(X) := (W(X)/~, cat) is called the __free group__ on X (or "with basis X").

--

There is an obvious map iota:
iota : X to F(X)
x mapsto [x]

1.8.2
prop [Universal Prop of F(X)]
For any group G and any map f : X to G, there exists a unique group morphism phi : F(X) to G s.t. iota.phi = f.  (this is the diagram *)

1.8.3
rmk
	a) iota is injective
	b) <X> (nerrrrrmm) = F(X)
	c) F(X) is characterized (up to isomorphism) by its universal property.
	d) If X, X' are sets with |X| = |X'|, then F(X) isom F(X').
		pf
		|X| = |X'| means there is a bijection b : X to X'.
		Then for each t in F(X), send t to representation from x els, then map with b, then finally to F(X').
		Show this is an isomorphism.

1.8.4
corr
Every group is (isomorphic to) a quotient of a free group.

1.8.5
def
An element of W(X) is __reduced__ if w has no subwords of the form yy'.
Wo(X) is the set of reduced words.

thm
every word corresponds (by deletion of yy' stuff) to a unique reduced word.

psi : Wo(X) to F(X)
psi(w) = [w]

psi is surjective, injective.  Therefore, we may identify (via psi) the elements of F(X) with those of Wo(X).

1.8.6
def
G group.  S set.  S subseteq G.  The __normal closure__ of S in G, denoted <S>_G, is the smallest normal subgroup of G which contains S.  (By definition, it is the intersection of all normal subgroups of G that contain S).

thm
<S>_G = { g1{s1}^{e1}g1'...gn{sn}^{en}gn' | n in N, g in G, s in S, e in {+-1}}

// How I think about free groups
// X --> W(X) --> C(X) --> F(X)
// W(X) is words on X.  These are finite sequences on X.
// C(X) is equivalence classes of words.  The equiv rel is defined inductively using (y,y') = (), etc.
// F(X) is C(X) together with the concatenation operation.

// X ----> F(X)
//   -      v
//    f-->  G

// Think of G as generated by X and with relations imposed by f.  The there is a homomorphism from F(X) to G by collapsing by the relations.

// thm [Awesome, on midterm]
// Every group of order n is cyclic iff (n, phi(n)) = 1.

1.8.7
def
A __presentation__ <X|R> of a group consists of a map f : X to G (which is often an embedding) and a subset of relations R subset F(X) s.t.
	a) <f(X)> = G
	b) <R>_{F(X)} = ker phi (in the diagram *) (note that <R> is ALL of the relations, whereas R is more like the "relation generators".  It is convenient if R is minimal.)
	notation) <X|R> isom G

1.8.8
rmk
	a) Usually one thinks of X as embedded in G and often doesn't distinguish (if f is injective) between x and f(x).
	If one starts with relations, you must check to see if such relations create identities between the elements of X.
	b) Technically, a "relation" is an element of R, and hence of F(X).  (each el is equiv to the identity)
	c) Given any X and any R IN F(X), there is always a group w/ presentation <X|R>, namely:
		G := F(X)/<R>_{F(X)}

If G is given with generating set X, in order to decide whether G has the presentation <X|R> for some R IN F(X), one must do the following: (let G~ = <X|R>)

X IN G, f iota G
X inclusion F(X)
F(X) phi G

	i) check whether for any reduced word w with [w] in R, the equation w = e holds in G.
	ii) If true, there exists a surjective homomorphism phi~: G~ onto G.

	F(X) phi G
	F(X) p onto G~
	G~ phi~ G

	ker p = <R> IN ker phi normal sbgrp F(X)
	phi~(g~) = phi(g) for any g in F(X) with p(g) = g~ (well-defined.)

	iii) Verify (often difficult!) that phi~ is injective.  (For finite groups, try |G~| <= |G|) (For infinite groups, try using 'normal forms' for the elements in G)

1.8.9
example
	(a) G = < a,b | a^2=b^2, a^3=b^3 >
	therefore, b=a
	So G = < a | e > = <a> isom Z

	(b) Presentation for S3 = <(12), (23)>?

	G~ = < a,b | a^2 = b^2 = 1; (ab)^3 = 1 > (so aba = bab)
	G' := {e, a, b, ab, ba, aba=bab}

	claim: G' = G

	observe aG' IN G' and bG' IN G'

	G~ <= <a,b> (note that <a,b> denoted the subgroup of G~ generated by a and b, NOT a free group)
	==> <a,b>.G' IN G' ==> G~G' IN G' ==> G~ IN G', so G~ = G'

	therefore, |G~| = |G'| <= |S3|

	Have a surj hom phi~ : G~ to S3
 	                       a mapsto (12)
	                       b mapsto (23)

	|G~| <= 6 = |S3|
	|G~| = 6, phi~ is bijective
	G~ isom S3, S3 has presentation < a,b | a^2 = b^2 = 1; (ab)^3 = 1 > (so aba = bab)

	(c) Q isom < a,b | a^4 = 1, a^2=b^2, aba'=b' >
		so b^4 = 1

	(d) Zm x Zn = < a,b | a^m=b^n=1, ab=ba > = { a^ib^i | 0 <= i <= m-1, 0 <= j <= n-1 }

	(e) D2n = < a,b | a^n=b^2=1, bab' = a' >

	(f) Doo = < a,b | b^2 = 1, bab' = a' >

prop [This is like a more general/practical version of the Univ. Prop of Free Groups]
Let G be a group with presentation <X|R> s.t. X embeds into G ( X IN G generates G ) (we write "X embeds into G" for convenience, because it means that X injects into G (no redundancies.  Here is an example without "embeds": <a,b | a^2=b^2, a^3=b^3 >.  Here, a=b, which is annoying.  So "embeds" gives us injectivity so we don't have to deal with the annoyingness.  But the proposition could still be formulated without it.).  If H is another group, then the function f : X to H extends (uniquely) to a morphism psi^ : G to H iff

	3. x in R and D = <x>

We will build a concept of element inversion for both 1. integral domains and 2. for any D = R \ P for any P prime.  This is called "localization".

' = inverse
let's invert D in some bigger ring D'R.
Start with R x D and define ~ equiv rel. as follows:
	(r,d) ~ (r',d')
	iff
	rd' = r'd
	iff
	rd' - r'd = 0

	but transitivity is not possible without integral domains...
	so modify relation to

	there exists some t in D s.t.
	t(rd' - r'd) = 0

	this definition will be equivalent to the above in integral domains.  But outside of integral domains, it works too!

notation
for some r in R and d in D, then
r/d
denotes the equiv class [(r,d)]

We want to introduce + and * operations as follows:
r/d + s/e = (re + sd)/de and r/d * s/e = rs/de

We need to verify both operations are well-defined!

The result is that D'R is a commutative ring with 1, and every d in D has an inverse element 1/d.

Wahoo!

0 in D <==> D'R = {0}

2.3.7
prop (Universal Prop of R[x])
R comm ring w/ 1.  For any commutative ring S w/ 1, any ring morphism phi : R to S and any a in S, there exists a unique ring morphism (phi_a)~ : R[x] to S (which i'll just call phi~) s.t. phi~(x) = a and phi~|_R = phi.

note
phi~(sum_{i=0}^{d} r_i x^i) = sum_{i=0}^{d} phi(r_i) a^i

rmk
phi~(R[x]) is a subring of S

If R is a subring of S, then we can use phi = inclusion, in which case,
phi~(R[x]) = { phi~(f) | f in R[x] } = { sum_{i=0}^{d} r_i a^i | d in N, r_i in R } is the smallest subring of S containing R and a.

examples
	(a) Z IN C.  Z[i] = { a + bi | a,b in Z } are the Gaussian integers!, a subring of C.
	(b) Z in Q.  Z[1/2] is the 2-adic numbers!, a subring of Q, the smallest containing Z and 1/2.

2.3.8
def
special case of 2.3.7
	Given S = R and phi = id and a in R, the __evaluation homomorphism__, also called the __evaluation at a__, is the phi~ sending x to a
denotation
	ev_a, or f(a)

note
We obtain a rin hom psi : R[x] to R^R = { h : R to R }.
If psi is injective, we can consider R[x] as a ring of runctions from R to R (a subring of R^R)

2.3.9
prop (Division algorithm for polynomial rings)
If f in R[x], f != 0, and l(f) in (R, *), then for any g in R[x], there exists a uniquely determined h,r in R[x] s.t. g = fh + r and deg(r) < deg(f).

pf
	Uniqueness:
	If g = h1f + r1 = h2f + r2
	then f(h1-h2) = r2-r1
	then deg(f(h1-h2)) = deg(r2-r1) < deg(f)
	then deg(f) + deg(h1-h2) < deg(f)
	then deg(h1-h2) < 0
	then h1 - h2 = 0
	then h1 = h2
	then r1 = r2

	Existence:
	If g = 0, then 0 = f*0 + 0
	If g != 0, then
	more generally, assume e := deg(g) >= deg(f) = d
	If e < d, then g = f*0 + g,
	Otherwise,
	proof by induction on e
	...

2.3.10
cor
If F is a field and f in F[x] is nonzero, then for all g in F[x], there exists a uniquely determined h,r in F[x] with g = fh + r and deg(r) < deg(f).
pf
	l(f) != 0 ==> l(f) in (F, *)
	Then it's true by 2.3.9.

2.3.11
examples
	(a) R = Z6, f = -x + 2, g = 2x^2 + 3.
	Then g / f = -2x - 4 with remainder -1

	(b) nonexample: R = Z, f = 2x + 1, g = x^2 - 1, l(f) = 2 which is *not* a unit in Z.  There are no h, r in Z[x] s.t. x^2 - 1 = (2x+1)h + r with deg(r) < 1.

	(c) R = Q, f = 2x + 1, g = x^2 - 1, find the h and r.  Yay!  Observe that h and r are unique, and since they are not in Z[x], this proves why (b) is impossible.

2.3.12
lemma
If g in R[x] and a in R, then ( g(a) = 0 <==> (x-a | g) in R[x] ).
pf
	l(x-a) = 1 in (R, *) ==> there exists h,r in R[x] s.t. g = h(x-a) + r, deg(r) < deg(x-a)
	then r is constant, so r in R
	apply ev_a
	g(a) = (a-a)h(a) +r = r
	then
	g(a) = 0 iff r = 0 iff g = (x-a)h iff (x-a | g) in R[x].
	QED.

2.3.13
prop
If R is a commutative domain, then any nonzero f in R[x] has at most deg(f) many roots.

rmk
If R is an algebraically closed field, then there are exactly deg(f) roots with multiplicity.

examples
	(a) nonexample: R = Z8, f = x^2 - 1, has roots 1, 3, 5, 7.  Note that Z8 is not a domain.
	(b) nonexample: R = Boolean ring: every r in R is a root of x^2 - x.

2.3.14
thm
If R is a comm domain, then any finite subgroup of (R, *) is cyclic.
pf
	Let A be a finite subgrp of R*.
	For any natural number m,
	    a^m = 1
	iff a^m - 1 = 0
	iff x^m - 1 has a as a root

	   |{a in A | a^m=1 }|
	<= |{a in R | a^m = 1}|
	=  |{roots in R of x^m-1}|
	<= m, by thm 2.3.13

	By thm 1.2.9(b), A is cyclic.

2.3.15
cor
If F is a finite field, then F* is cyclic.
In particular, Zp* isom Z{p-1}
note that 2.3.14 completes the proof of 1.2.5 !!!

Euclidean Domains

def
A __degree__ function d satisfies
	d: R\{0} to N
for all a,b in R where a !=0, there exists q,r in R s.t.
b = qa + r
and
r=0 or d(r) < d(a).

rmk
TF are NOT required
	* uniqueness of q, r
	* d(0)=0
	* d(a) <= d(ab) if a,b in R\{0}

2.4.1
def
A domain is __Euclidean__ if it is commutative and has a degree function

2.4.2
examples
	(a) R = Z, d(a) = |a|
	(b) R = F[x], d(f) = deg(f) for f in F[x]
	    2.4.1 is satisfied by 2.3.10
	(c) R = F field, d can be any function from F\{0} to N

2.4.3
thm
Every Euclidean domain is a PID
pf
	Given R is E.D.  Given any ideal I in R.  Let a in I be an element of minimal degree.  We will show I = (a).  Let b in I.  Then there exists q,r s.t. b = qa + r w/ r=0 or deg(r) < deg(a).
	r = b - qa, so r in I since b and a in I.  By minimality of degree of a, we conclude r=0.

2.4.4
def
Given a comm ring R, and a,b,c in R, then c is a __common divisor__ of a and b if c|a and c|b.
def
A common devisor C of a and b is __greatest__ if all common divisors c of a and b satisfy c|C.
rmk
It follows that gcd(0,0) = 0

2.4.5
rmk
	(a) For all units u in R, u*gcd(a,b) = gcd(a,b)
	(b) If R is a comm domain and c = gcd(a,b) and c' = gcd(a,b), then there exists a u in R s.t. c = uc'
	(c) gcd(a,b) need not exist

examples
	R = Z[sqrt(5)], a = 2(1+sqrt(-5)), b = 6 = 2*3 = (1+sqrt(5))(1-sqrt(5))
	Then we have common divisors +-1, +-2, and +-(1+sqrt(-5)), but neither divides the other, so there is no gcd.

2.4.6
lemma
R comm ring.
	1) c|a and c|b <==> (a,b) IN (c)
	2) (a,b) = (c) ==> c = gcd(a,b)
rmk
	If R is a PID, then for any a,b in R, gcd(a,b) exists.  namely, the generator of (a,b)
rmk
	c can be determined by Euclidean Algo, and it also provides x,y s.t. ax + by = c.

2.4.8
prop
Euclidean Algo
If R is a E.D., a,b in R, a nonzero, then there exists a finite chain of equations of the form, for q's, r's in R,
  b = q0 a + r1 	and d(r1) < d(a)
  a = q1 r1 + r2 	and d(r2) < d(r1)
  r1 = q1 r2 + r3 	and d(r3) < d(r2)
  r2 = q1 r3 + r4 	and d(r4) < d(r3)
  ...
  r{n-1} = q1 rn + r{n+1} 	and d(r{n+1}) = 0
Then
	(a) d(ri) <= d(a) - i , squigglearrow n <= d(a)
	(b) (a,b) = (r{i-1}, ri) = (rn) ==> gcd(a,b) = rn by 2.4.6
	(c) If we define inductively
		alpha{-1} = 0, beta{-1} := 1,
		alpha0 = 1, beta0 = 0
		alphai = alpha{i-2} - q{i-1}alpha{i-1}, betai = beta{i-2} - q{i-1}beta{i-1}
	then for all i,
		ri = alphai a + betai b
	and hence
		rn = alphan a + betan b

2.4.9
quadratic number fields.
Fix m in Z \ {0,1} square free, that is, m = -1 or m = product of distinct primes.
Then sqrt(m) not in Q
if m < 0, sqrt(m) in C \ R
if m > 1, m = p1...pe ==> for all nonzero integers a, ma^2 not in (unique prime factorization) Z2

So if sqrt(m) in Q, then sqrt(m) = b/q ==> a^2m = b^2, a contradiction,

consequence
for some s, t in Q, s + t*sqrt(m) = 0  ==>  t = s = 0
That is, 1,sqrt(m) is a Q-basis of K := Km := Q[sqrt(m)] = { s + t*sqrt(m) | s,t in Q }
Km is closed under + and * ==> subring of C
Define phi : K to K
by phi(s+t*sqrt(m)) = s-t*sqrt(m)
check phi is ring hom and phi|_Q = id|_Q, phi^2 = id|_K.

def
The __norm__ N : K to Q is defined by N(z) = z*phi(z).
rmk
	(i) N(s+t*sqrt(m)) = s^2 - t^2m in Q
	(ii) N(z) = 0 ==> s^2 = t^2m ==> t = 0 ==> s = 0
	otherwise, t !=0 ==> m = s^2/t^2 ==> sqrt(m) = +-s/t in Q contradiction
	(iii) z1,z2 in K ==> N(z1z2) = z1z2phi(z1z2) = z1phi(z1)z2phi(z2) = N(z1)N(z2)

consequences
	(1) K is a field
	(2) N : K* to Q* is a group hom.

2.4.10
lemma
If R subring of Km satisfying N(R) = Z, then
	(a) a|b in R ==> N(a)|N(b) in Z
	(b) phi(R) IN R ==> R* = { a in R | N(a) = +-1 }
	(c) If for all z in K, there exists q in R s.t. |N(z-q)| < 1, then R is a E.D. with d(a) := |N(a)|.
