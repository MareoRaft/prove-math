...on NetworkX in Python

Victoria uses Digital Ocean.  It's cheap! 


1. Create own module for a node (def, thm, ex, etc)

2. Use NetworkX to create graph with the pointers

3. Pickle the graph (will this save the node objects too?) (or a graph format like GML) Graph Modelling Language
other options for saving a graph: https://networkx.github.io/documentation/latest/reference/readwrite.html

4. Find a JS graph library to manage client side.




--------------------------

1. create company nammed Prove Math, LLC in Delaware.

2. create an internship to fill content.  We could really use a CompSci guy for programming!!

3. consider copyrighting or copylefting or patenting the idea: Firslt, to FORMAT math definitions, thrms, etc as a DIRECTED GRAPH which is VISIBLE to the user so that they can SEE the connections, TRACK their progress, DECIDE in what direction they want to learn. (Algorithms to suggest which definitions to learn, cloud, depth).  To enable professors to create AN ONLINE COURSE CURRICULUM by choosing a connected subgraph and sharing it w/ students, track their progress, etc.

figure out how to configure sudoers?

-------------------------------

use a template system to all users to choose preferences such as:
1. boxed iff or if and only if
2. always all, always each, or always every, or the default mix up
3. color scheme
4. zoom prefs (or maybe size of nodes, tightness of edges?)

send out a FB message about internship AFTER finals.  Ask Sarah Grace (Liu) to spread it.
