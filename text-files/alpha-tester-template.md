You are officially invited to be an alpha-tester of provemath.org!


While provemath.org is not yet ready for the general public, we are asking a small number of people we know well to try it out and give constructive feedback.  Your feedback is a great help to us.

Directions:
---------------
  1. Visit http://provemath.org
  2. Choose one of the providers that you already have an account with in order to create your provemath account.  By logging in, provemath will remember your personal settings and progress you make on the site.
  3. Click on a node to view its definition and information.  Click "I learn it" or "Got it!" if you completely understand the node.
  4. The math on provemath is structured in the following way:  Given any node, the nodes that point to it are its "dependencies".  **You should "learn" all of the dependencies before you attempt to learn the node itself.**  Therefore, you should begin at one of the gray nodes (the gray nodes have no dependencies), and from there, work your way forwards.
  5. While viewing a node's information, you may click on the edit icon to put it in *edit* mode.  You can then edit the information, and click save to view the final-product of your changes.  In the future, these changes will be permanently saved for everyone (the math on provemath is one big repository for everybody to share).


We appreciate any suggestions for improvements.  Please feel free to reply to this email with any questions and/or suggestions.

:)
