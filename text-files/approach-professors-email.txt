Dear PROFESSOR,

I have been developing a project over the past 9 months which allows students to learn SUBJECT.  I would like to provide this tool to the students for free.  This could help the students to review, and it would help me to measure the effectiveness of the tool.  Are you open to meeting at your office one day to get some details on the project?

Best,
SENDER
