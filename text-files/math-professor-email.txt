Professor [name],

I graduated recently from Rutgers New Brunswick under the math honors track.  While preparing for graduate school, I began a math project which aims to represent mathematics as a directed acyclic graph.  The goal is to create a user contributable database that is accessible online.

Serious content contributors to this project must define and prove math in a complete and rigorous manner.  I believe this will have a large benefit on the way students learn mathematics.  Not only will contributors need to understand the math they contribute fully, but users will benefit from seeing the "bigger picture" structure of what they learn.

I would like to continue this project over the next semester in the form of an independent study, so that students who wish to contribute may receive credit for it.  I currently have one student, Ali Haider Ismail, who is interesting in building abstract algebra material for this project in conjunction with taking 451 and 452 next year.  We would be very happy if a professor was willing to approve such an independent study.

Would you be willing to meet with me and discuss in further detail what this project entails?

Thank you kindly,
Matthew Lancellotti
