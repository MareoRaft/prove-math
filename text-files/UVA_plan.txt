How to proceed w/ ProveMath @ UVA:

1. Find math ppl in math dept interested in education.  Talk to some and maybe one might be your advisor.

2. Through that math person, try to connect with someone in:
	UVA Curry Math Education
	In Curry School of Education there is a Mathematics Education

3. The idea is that if provemath becomes your thesis project, then you can have two advisors (one from math dept and one from curry math ed).

4. Then contact Mark Sherriff to be listed on the website for Engineering capstone project (Comp Sci students are listed in the engineering dept).  So comp sci students doing their capstone project can work on parts of provemath project.
