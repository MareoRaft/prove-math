Internships for Math and Comp Sci students,

Prove Math is building a revolutionary college-level math education website!  We need strong math students with proofing skills and upper-level math courses.  If accepted, you will be building content in the field of your choice.

We also need strong programmers.  One with experience in databases, one in the Python language, and one in javascript.  An understanding of efficiency is important.

We will be meeting on Busch campus at Rutgers.  The internship is currently available for this summer and for the fall semester.  The internship is unpaid.  We are working on a program where you can receive course credit for your involvement.  If interested, please email admin@provemath.org with the following information:
