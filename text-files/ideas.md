1. a "review" mode which is like a QuizUp quiz.  It quizzes you on things you know, in such a way as to not be redundant. (won't repeat anything, won't repeat things too closely related (depending on settings you set)).

The quiz and the program itself may have some sort of positive feedback feature (points, stars, or whatnot), since that seems to motivate ppl on KA and SO.

The quiz will REMEMBER what it has quizzed you on in the past, so that it can TARGET the things you may be forgetting, and leave alone the things you have recently visited!
2. the ability for users to find other users who have similar skills or "complementing" skills (for the purpose of collaboration).
3. Oauth accounts (FB, google+, etc)
4. API for people to request nodes in the form of json dictionaries
5. Zero is a natural number
6. Analysis and real analysis are separate topics that may be linked at some point
7.
