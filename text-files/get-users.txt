GET USERS
==============

Use your target audience to come up with ideas for getting users.  Target audience should be specific.  Think of other possible target audiences.

Math Majors
-----------------
  * RU mailing list for math majors
  * RU graph theory and combinatorics courses --> ask professors to give info to students and/or put provemath.org on course website / syllabus
  * meet w/ undergrad profs in general to tell them about provemath and see what they think about integrating it into a course
  * Try spending 1 week per strategy and measure the results closely of how effective each one is
  * social media --> see if there are MATH groups and post there

Other
-------------
  * ads --> not a good idea at this point
  * social media --> get a lot of followers by posting 2wice a day over the course of months



KEEP USERS

Good first impression
-----------------------------
  * Landing page is welcoming, says "ProveMath", has a short blurb about what this is, and then a TUTORIAL VIDEO.  login to play!
  * put a field for email address when ppl login.  store the address and then send a one-time email to users asking for feedback
  * email some sort of weekly newsletter: "Here's a cool proof!" sort of thing. --> use MailChimp.
